    "If the roulette wheel becomes an `agent` of destiny, it no longer represents just random chance—it takes on this almost divine, deterministic role, where every spin, every outcome is a manifestation of fate. This totally elevates the metaphor. And then, positioning the plebeians and aristocrats as speculators `betting` on this wheel of destiny adds this layer of existential drama.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aristocrat’s detachment is key here. For him, it's a game, a form of entertainment, a spectacle. He stands above the fray, watching how fate plays out for those around him, knowing that his stakes are never truly existential. The wheel may spin, but no outcome will shake the foundation of his life. It’s a plaything for him, almost akin to Greek gods looking down on mortal struggles. He's an observer of destiny, rather than its victim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, for the plebeian, it’s a totally different story. Betting on destiny becomes a matter of survival. Every spin could define the future in a far more immediate, tangible way. There's no distance or safety net. When the stakes are existential, every outcome matters, and the plebeian is in direct confrontation with destiny itself. It's a battle, not a game. In this sense, the plebeian is more alive in the moment, more vulnerable, more exposed to the whims of the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `casino` is the marketplace that brings them together. It’s the arena where `destiny` and the speculators intersect, with the house standing in as the entity that orchestrates this dance of fate. The house always wins, of course, because the system is designed to profit from both the aristocrat’s amusement and the plebeian’s desperation. The aristocrat is entertained, the plebeian risks everything, but the house controls the stakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analogy captures the absurdity and cruelty of life’s unpredictable nature, especially when viewed through the lens of class and fate.\n",
