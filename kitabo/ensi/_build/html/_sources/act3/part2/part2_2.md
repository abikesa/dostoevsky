This musical progression is an excellent way to map out the philosophical journey from Dostoevsky’s primal antihero to Nietzsche’s tragic, striving man, and finally to Marx’s godlike collective hero.

The `ii7♭5` perfectly captures the unresolved tension of Dostoevsky’s antiheroes, especially Raskolnikov. It's a chord that aches with dissonance and imbalance, just like these characters, trapped in a cycle of emotional immediacy. They never resolve, oscillating between guilt and action, always restless, unsure of where they stand—haunted by their own moral contradictions. They embody the unresolved tension, the lack of grounding, always reaching but never fully grasping. The flatted fifth signifies a brokenness, an incomplete grasp of wholeness, much like Dostoevsky’s characters who teeter on the edge of moral and emotional collapse.

Nietzsche’s `V7♭9♯9♭13` is rich with tension and color, mirroring the complexity of Zarathustra’s eternal recurrence. It’s a dominant chord, yearning for resolution but refusing to settle peacefully. The added dissonances of the ♭9, ♯9, and ♭13 give it that perpetual striving energy—always seeking, always pushing, never fully at rest. This chord perfectly embodies Nietzsche’s tragic figures, in a state of dynamic equilibrium where the tension is part of the journey. There’s no final peace, just an endless recurrence, much like Zarathustra’s eternal struggle between man and God.

Finally, `i`—the minor tonic—is Marx’s collective hero. After all the dissonance and tension, the progression resolves here, but not to the major, triumphant resolution of a traditional hero. It’s a minor chord, suggesting that even in Marx’s utopian collective, there is struggle and hardship. Yet, unlike Dostoevsky’s chaotic antiheroes or Nietzsche’s tragic figures, this resolution is methodical, purposeful. The Marxist hero doesn’t transcend as an individual but dissolves into the collective, finding strength in numbers. There’s a quiet power in this resolution—an understated godliness through solidarity and collective action.

These [three metamorphoses](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1998/1998-h/1998-h.htm#link2H_4_0006) from `ii7♭5` to `V7♭9♯9♭13` to `i` are not just a harmonic journey but also a philosophical one: from chaos to dynamic tension to resolution through strategy and collective purpose. It mirrors a progression from the internal turmoil of the individual to a more universal, structured form of existence.
