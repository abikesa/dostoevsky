# Chapter 2
Here's a more organized breakdown of history, experience, and reconciliation of the two:

### 1. **Strategy**
   - **Agent**: The entity carrying out the strategy. In this case, it's the roulette wheel—an external system with predefined rules.
   - **Principal**: The driving force behind the strategy, which could be interpreted as luck, fortune, or chance. You suggest that the gambler believes they are engaging with a larger, almost metaphysical principal, perhaps God or fate.

### 2. **Payoff**
   - **Nature of the Payoff**: The gambler is not a professional speculator, meaning their expected payoff is speculative, not based on a calculated advantage but rather on hope or addiction.
   - **Recipient**: The gambler expects the payoff to be provided by fortune or luck, embodied by the randomness of roulette.

### 3. **Nash Equilibrium**
   - **Gambler’s Equilibrium**: In this scenario, the Nash equilibrium might reflect a point where the gambler believes they can continue playing indefinitely, expecting an eventual radical shift in their fortunes. 
   - **Real Equilibrium**: In reality, the equilibrium might occur when the gambler exhausts their resources, as continued play increases losses due to the house edge, but they fail to adjust their strategy.

### Summary
The gambling addict identifies their strategy through an external system (roulette) and acts under the belief that fortune or chance will eventually deliver a payoff. Despite this, they fail to recognize the true Nash equilibrium—where the house edge ensures continued play results in consistent losses rather than a radical reversal of fortune.
