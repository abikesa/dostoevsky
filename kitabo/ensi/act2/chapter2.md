# Chapter 2
Storytelling mirrors reality in its inherent [incompleteness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxB_tYCOAMY). For instance, one may think of Flamenco as the following chord progression in Phrygian mode: A-G-F-E. But the improviser may "recover" what is ommitted or implied by the harmonic series: e.g. A-`D`-G-`C`-F-`Fdom`-E:

A complete narrative arc (e.g. from a fully-parametric distribution) can be compared to a smooth curve, but life’s data is always missing points—fragments of experience, emotion, or information left unfilled (non-parametric distribution). 1 It’s this very incompleteness that drives human cognition. Music, more than any other form of art, rewards the engaged listener with a question about the “NexToken” & empirically provides answers every other measure. Film, theater, and poetry do likewise. However, if at all brevity is the soul of wit…

In storytelling, the missing pieces—whether gaps in a character’s backstory, unspoken emotional undertones, or unresolved plotlines—are essential because they force the audience to engage in imputation. This is where the richness lies. Our minds fill in those gaps through interpolation (connecting the dots between known points), extrapolation (projecting beyond what’s given), and retrodiction (reconstructing the past based on the present). This process taps into the core of how we make sense of reality itself.

Professionals, like scientists, musicians, poets, and analysts, rely on these cognitive tools to process incomplete data sets—whether it’s in the form of trends, musical phrases, or human behavior. This is a dynamic process of building meaning from fragments, just as we do in life. It’s what makes art, music, and narrative so deeply engaging: the mind’s constant dance between what is given and what is inferred. The mastery in storytelling comes from knowing what to leave out (a sort of self-imposed fetter) and trusting the audience to fill in the rest (a sort of gift in practiced-overcoming).

```{admonition} Chordal & Modal
:class: tip
This is the charm of music, the reason it keeps us guessing. It’s not the notes themselves that captivate us, but the spaces between them, the implied nextoken that pulls us forward, much like life itself—one big question mark, yet utterly engaging. Music is the human mind’s way of imposing signal on the cosmic noise, and within that signal lies the infinite variety that keeps us eternally captivated, always listening for what comes next.
